# VellumFE Keybind Configuration
# This file contains all keyboard bindings
# Editable via .addkeybind/.keybinds commands or directly in this file
#
# TERMINAL COMPATIBILITY NOTE:
# If backspace doesn't work, your terminal may be sending "delete" instead.
# Try changing the line below from:
#   backspace = "cursor_backspace"
# to:
#   delete = "cursor_backspace"
#
# To find what key code your terminal sends, run with RUST_LOG=debug
# and check ~/.vellum-fe/debug.log for "KEY EVENT" lines
#
# Available actions:
#   send_command, cursor_left, cursor_right, cursor_word_left, cursor_word_right,
