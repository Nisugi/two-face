# Acknowledgments

Recognition of projects, people, and resources that made Two-Face possible.

## Inspiration

### Profanity

Two-Face draws significant inspiration from [Profanity](https://github.com/rspeicher/profanity), the pioneering terminal-based client for GemStone IV. Profanity demonstrated that a modern, efficient terminal interface was not only possible but could provide a superior gameplay experience.

### Lich

[Lich](https://lichproject.org/) has been instrumental to the GemStone IV community, providing scripting capabilities and serving as an excellent proxy for frontend development. Two-Face's Lich mode exists thanks to Lich's well-designed proxy interface.

### StormFront and Wizard

The official Simutronics clients (StormFront, Wizard Front End) established the standard for GemStone IV interfaces and defined the XML protocol that Two-Face parses.

## Open Source Libraries

Two-Face is built on excellent open source foundations:
