//! Frontend abstraction layer
//!
//! This module defines the `Frontend` trait that both TUI and GUI frontends must implement.
//! It provides a unified interface for event polling, rendering, and cleanup.

/// Frontend trait - must be implemented by both TUI and GUI frontends
///
/// The Frontend trait separates rendering concerns from business logic.
/// All frontends (TUI via ratatui, GUI via egui) implement this trait
/// to provide a consistent interface to the core application.
pub trait Frontend {
    /// Poll for user input events
    ///
    /// This method should return all pending events (keyboard, mouse, resize, etc.)
    /// converted to the frontend-agnostic `FrontendEvent` enum.

    /// - `app` - Mutable reference to the application (allows widgets to update state during render)
    ///
    /// # Returns
    /// - `Ok(())` - Render successful
    /// - `Err(...)` - If rendering failed

    /// and perform any necessary cleanup before the application exits.

    /// - `Err(...)` - If cleanup failed

    ///
    /// Returns the current dimensions of the rendering area.
    /// For TUI: terminal size in characters
    /// For GUI: window size in pixels (may be converted to logical units)
